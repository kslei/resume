I have to raise and cultivate my beloved daughter, give her a good education and help her become independent. This is what keeps me constantly moving forward.</div>

But only when you see the results of your labor, and the work makes you think and look for solutions - only then the work brings pleasure.</div>
          <div className='content__description'>I also value my friends. They are real, time-tested. And despite the fact that we are different, we treat each other with respect and understanding. </div>
